## Summary

Are you a tech manager, looking for help becoming a good one? Not sure what
you don't know yet, or feeling uncertain about tasks that are outside of your comfort zone?
This Guide is written for the new manager of a team of engineers -- systems, software,
networking, or any other flavor -- or for managers who want to develop their skills.

Many tech managers are thrown in with no background in management or leadership, because we
are good engineers, and that is the default promotion path in many organizations.
However, the skill sets that make one a successful individual contributor are not the 
same skill sets that make one a successful leader of people.

For those who have been put in a management role and now want to increase your knowledge,
I hope these short articles will provide ideas and tools to help you succeed in your new career.

This guide has been inspired by the excellent [How to be a Programmer](https://github.com/braydie/HowToBeAProgrammer)
project and owes it a debt of gratitude for inspiring a simple, straightforward treatment
of a complex topic.

## How to Use This Guide

The articles in this guide are short and can be read on their own in only a few minutes 
each, as you're starting to browse, but the guide is meant to be read as a whole. 

Get started reading at the [Table of Contents (English)](en/README.md).
