## Summary

Are you a tech manager, looking for help becoming a good one? Not sure what
you don't know yet, or feeling uncertain about tasks that are outside of your comfort zone?
This Guide is written for the new manager of a team of engineers -- systems, software,
networking, or any other flavor -- or for managers who want to develop their skills.

Many tech managers are thrown in with no background in management or leadership, because we
are good engineers, and that is the default promotion path in many organizations.
However, the skill sets that make one a successful individual contributor are not the 
same skill sets that make one a successful leader of people.

For those who have been put in a management role and now want to increase your knowledge,
I hope these short articles will provide ideas and tools to help you succeed in your new career.

This guide has been inspired by the excellent [How to be a Programmer](https://github.com/braydie/HowToBeAProgrammer)
project and owes it a debt of gratitude for inspiring a simple, straightforward treatment
of a complex topic.

## How to Use This Guide

The articles in this guide are short and can be read on their own in only a few minutes 
each, as you're starting to browse, but the guide is meant to be read as a whole. 

Get started with the [Table of Contents (English)](en/README.md).

# The principles of this Guide (unless you have better ideas)

1. **This is for everyone.** This project is licensed for sharing, including by
commercial entities who may wish to build materials which they will not share
back, such as business training materials. Community contributions to extend
and enhance the Guide are welcome.
1. **Use plain language.** The Guide is here to make life easier. Using
short declarative sentences is easier to read. If there are two words that
can convey the same idea, prefer the shorter, more common variant. Avoid idioms,
metaphors, and in-jokes that will not reach all audiences. 
1. **The meritocracy is a myth.** We are all human, and we want to believe that as
colleagues and especially as managers we make fair decisions. However, we are
all susceptible to unconscious biases and preferences, and to be frank, equal 
treatment does not always result in equitable outcomes. When a topic has exposure
to bias, such as discussions on performance management or hiring, take care to 
provide necessary mechanisms to prevent bias and to promote diversity and inclusion.
1. **Operations must be sustainable.** Just because someone can be paged does not
mean they should be. Being a good manager in a technical organization means 
facilitating a healthy balance for your engineers so that the workload or the 
nature of the work does not burn them out. And the resources in our platforms,
such as the precious metals in servers, infrastructure costs (even in the cloud), or excess
scaling capacity, are not unbounded either. When a topic has exposure to 
waste or inefficiency, take care to provide mechanisms to be responsible with
your resource usage.
