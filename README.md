# How to be a Manager in Tech

This guide is written for the new manager of a team of engineers -- systems, software,
networking, or any other flavor -- or for managers who want to develop their skills.
Many of us are thrown in with no background in management or leadership, because we
are good engineers and this is the default promotion path in many organizations.
However, the skill sets that make one a successful engineer as an individual
contributor are not the same skill sets that make one a successful leader of people.
For those who have been thrown in to the deep end and want to learn how move beyond
treading water, I hope these articles will provide what you need to succeed in your
new career.

## How to Use This Guide

The articles in this guide are short and can be read on their own, as you're
starting to browse, but the guide is meant to be read as a whole. 

Get started with the [Table of Contents](TOC.md).

# The principles of this Guide (unless you have better ideas)

In the spirit of open source, please feel free to contribute articles on
new topics, or amendments to existing ones. These are the tenets
for this guide:

1. **Write in plain language.** The guide is here to make life easier. Using
short declarative sentences is easier to read. If there are two words that
can convey the same idea, prefer the shorter, more common variant. Avoid idioms,
metaphors, and in-jokes that will not reach all audiences. 
1. **The meritocracy is a myth.** We are all human, and we want to believe that as
colleagues and especially as managers we make fair decisions. However, we are
all susceptible to unconscious biases and preferences. When an article has exposure
to bias, such as discussions on performance management or hiring, take care to 
provide necessary mechanisms to prevent bias and to promote diversity and inclusion.
1. **Operations must be sustainable.** Just because someone can be paged does not
mean they should be. Being a good manager in a technical organization means 
facilitating a healthy balance for your engineers so that the workload or the 
nature of the work does not burn them out. And the resources in our hardware,
the precious metals, the infrastructure costs (even in the cloud), or excess
scaling overhead, are not unbounded either. When an article has exposure to 
waste or inefficiency, take care to provide mechanisms to be responsible with
your resource usage.

## (and some fine print)

* This Guide has a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
* Style conforms to American English spelling and conventions, including the 
Oxford comma and placing punctuation inside quote marks. 
* Write in the second ("you click") or third person ("they click"). Avoid first person ("I click"). Use singular they in the third person.
* Write in the active voice ("they write code") rather than passive ("code is written 
by them").
* Use people-based language. The people who report to the people reading this 
Guide are "engineers," not "directs," "reports," or "resources." (If appropriate,
terms like "new hire" can be used for disambiguation.)
