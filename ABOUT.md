# The principles for How to be a Manager in Tech (unless you have better ideas)

1. **This is for everyone.** This project is licensed for sharing, including by
commercial entities who may wish to build materials which they will not share
back, such as business training materials. Community contributions to extend
and enhance the Guide are welcome.
1. **Use plain language.** The Guide is here to make life easier. Using
short declarative sentences is easier to read. If there are two words that
can convey the same idea, prefer the shorter, more common variant. Avoid idioms,
metaphors, and in-jokes that will not reach all audiences. 
1. **Answer what, why, and how.** Each article should cover a single topic (though
it may reference others), and it should explain why that skill is important, and 
how someone can learn it. We start from the perspective that all shortcomings can
be fixed or resolved, so use solutions-oriented language.
1. **The meritocracy is a myth.** We are all human, and we want to believe that as
colleagues and especially as managers we make fair decisions. However, we are
all susceptible to unconscious biases and preferences, and to be frank, equal 
treatment does not always result in equitable outcomes. When a topic has exposure
to bias, such as discussions on performance management or hiring, take care to 
provide necessary mechanisms to prevent bias and to promote diversity and inclusion.
1. **Operations must be sustainable.** Just because someone can be paged does not
mean they should be. Being a good manager in a technical organization means 
facilitating a healthy balance for your engineers so that the workload or the 
nature of the work does not burn them out. And the resources in our platforms,
such as the precious metals in servers, infrastructure costs (even in the cloud), or excess
scaling capacity, are not unbounded either. When a topic has exposure to 
waste or inefficiency, take care to provide mechanisms to be responsible with
your resource usage.
