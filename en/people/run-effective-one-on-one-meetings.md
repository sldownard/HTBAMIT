# How to run effective one-on-one meetings

Effective managers have regular meetings with each of their engineers on a regular cadence,
called either one-on-ones or face-to-faces. If you want to have a good rapport with 
the people on your team, understand their motivations and make them productive, you should
too. The time that you invest in one-on-ones (and it will be a good chunk of time) is
repaid by the healthy relationship between you and your engineers, your greater insight 
into and influence on their career development and performance, and their increased engagement.

When you think about setting the agenda for your one-on-ones, remember that the first, 
inviolable rule of one-on-ones is: it's not about you. This is their time.
Your job is to listen and to help them solve their problems. Create your agenda around
that theme: what do they think is going well or what do they need help with? What cool
things have they encountered lately? What development goals do they have for themselves,
or how can you help get them what they need to meet their goals? What things that you 
do could you do more of, and what should you do less of, to help them be more successful?

The second rule is that you need to be consistent. Set up the meeting on a recurring
schedule, and stick to it. Cancel other meetings if you have to, but only cancel your
one-on-ones if you cannot reschedule and have no other choice. Consistently making time
for them  is how you show your engineers that they are equally important as other 
things going on in the office, and that you value their time and are actively interested 
helping them.

The third rule is, once you're in the meeting, really listen actively to what they are
saying. Active listening means fully putting your attention on what they're saying, and
asking questions, but not offering advice, and definitely never letting your mind drift.
You will have to avoid the tendency to start imagining how you want to respond to something
that they said, while they are still talking. Active listening means listening and 
concentrating on understanding, not just killing time waiting for your turn to talk.

And last, once you've been made space for people, prioritized their concerns, and really
heard them out and empathized with them, at that point, start working together to 
remove their blockers, increase your trust, and build on your relationship so that 
you are both effective and productive at work.
