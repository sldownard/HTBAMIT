# How to create career development paths

One of the hardest things for anyone to do is to figure out where your career is headed.
As the manager of a team, you need to help all of your engineers with that, from the
perspective of helping guide them on the paths that they will be considering.

Established organizations often have some sort of career path, even if it's not very
formal and is more of a convention than a hard-and-fast rule. Something like junior 
developer, developer, senior developer. But a lot of places stop there, and don't define
what the criteria are to actually make it to the next level, leaving promotions up
to the manager's discretion, which can mean that the engineer and the manager have 
different ideas about what the engineer's potential actually is to reach the next level.

Of course, if you work in a small or new organization, you may not have formal career 
paths set out for your engineering roles at all -- you hire someone, they get a title 
that seems more or less in line with their skills and experience (or you give them 
the title they asked for), and things go along for a while. But sooner or later, they 
are going to want to get to the next level, and if you haven't actually defined what 
the next level means or what it takes to get there, you and your engineers are going 
to be out of alignment and someone will inevitably be disappointed.

Missing out on that planning is how you wind up with a system that turns excellent 
senior engineers into mediocre managers by default. Now that you're the manager (and
you don't want to be mediocre!), you have three tasks:

1. Define the career paths. You should have at least two.
   1. The first path is a senior engineering path, that leads to a terminal role as 
   a senior engineer. A terminal role is one where 
   further advancement is not required, so long as you keep meeting the requirements
   for that position; you could work in that role and level for 20 years and then retire.
   This is where you find titles like Principal Engineer, Staff Engineer, Fellow, or 
   Distinguished Engineer. You'll have one of these engineering paths for each 
   specialty, like security engineers, system engineers, network engineers, developers,
   etc., although you might find that as the roles get more senior, they blend into 
   each other, with the person's specialty defining their problems space but not really
   differentiating them from other very senior engineers.
   2. The second is a leadership path. Those of your engineers who have the skills to
   be good managers, technical project managers, or product managers should have a 
   chance to make the role transition. It is definitely a career change, though, and
   not a "promotion" per se.
1. Define the functions of each job at each level. A junior developer has different
   expectations of them than a senior developer. What are the expectations? Define
   what it means to be the level 1, 2, and 3 (and above!) engineers. Get input from
   people in the roles already, and ask them what sort of complexity they deal with.
   Once you build a matrix, and it's accepted by management, post it to the wiki or
   other place where people can refer to it at will. The career development matrix
   should become a tool that people are very familiar with. There are lots of examples
   you can look at for inspiration (see Additional Reading, below).
1. Talk to your engineers. Find out where their interests lie. Ask them what problems
   they want to work on -- not necessarily problems on your team or even at your
   company, but what sort of problems in general. You'll find out things like 
   someone is interested in doing security but doesn't know where to start, someone else wants
   to help solve climate change-related issues, someone who really likes what they're
   doing right now and mostly wishes people would quit asking them where they want to 
   be in five years. Once you know what people are interested in, you can talk about
   how to get them there, by choosing the right work and projects to build the skills
   required for their next role.
