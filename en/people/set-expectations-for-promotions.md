# How to set expectations for promotions

Misalignment of expectations, when it comes to whether or not someone is on their way to a
promotion, is a great way to turn over your staff. 

If you've done a good job defining what [the responsibilities are for job roles and 
levels](create-career-development-paths.md) in your team, and you've published the
definitions and had productive discussions with your engineers about where they fit
in on that chart, then the two of you should be well-aligned in terms of what they
need to do to make it to the next level, and about when they can expect that to 
happen.  

If you haven't ever had a discussion with your engineers where one of you asked the
other to tell them honestly, how close the engineer is to a promotion, though, 
then how will you know if you are both expecting similar outcomes? If one of your
engineers thinks they are doing well and certainly about to get promoted, but you 
think they have about two years' work between them and a senior role, that's a disaster
that could have been avoided with a few open, two-way conversations and well-chosen
skills development or training opportunities.

When you're checking in with your engineers during their one-on-ones, periodically
talking about their career goals and what project work you have that they can develop
their skills on, talk to them about how they think they are doing in their career. 
While they talk, if they sound overly optimistic, don't listen to them and think 
to yourself, "I don't think they're as close as they think they
are." You can't make promises, but you need to push back on unrealistic expectations.
Think about some get-rich-quick or lose-weight-fast scheme someone you knew was
let down by -- if they'd had realistic expectations, they would not have been 
disappointed. Try and take time and emotion out of career progress and promotion 
discussions as much as possible, even if 
the person makes an ultimatum, like "if I don't make senior in six months, I'm 
quitting." If you are objective, and your assessment is objective and predictable
because it's based on something defined like a role responsibilities matrix, you
will have a much better chance of getting alignment on expectations.
