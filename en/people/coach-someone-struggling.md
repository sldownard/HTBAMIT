# How to coach someone who is struggling

If all our engineers were driven, perfectly knowledgable in their subject areas, responsible, 
and communicated well, they wouldn't need us to manage them. But they do.

If you have been having open conversations with your engineers, in one-on-ones and ad hoc 
meetings, about their careers, goals, and performance, it will be easy to detect someone who
is struggling before it becomes the sort of problem that needs a performance improvement
plan to correct. If you are taking over a new team, though, and you have underperforming
engineers that you need to start coaching, you might need to do additional work building 
a rapport with them so that they are open to accepting advice from you.

Coaching an underperforming engineer is the same as doing performance management to move
someone along in their career. Identify where they should be (or want to be), analyze
where they're at right now, and plan to cover the gaps. An underperforming engineer may
just have a skills gap, or may have other things that make it hard to recover from where
they're at, like a painful history with other managers, rocky relationship with the team, 
disengagement, or other factors -- you need to pick up
on those and work to improve them just like you would an engineer who lacks regular
soft skills. This is where empathy comes in. Talk to the person and see what you can 
find out about the reasons they are underperforming, by asking probing questions and using 
active listening. If you start by hearing them and understanding their position, it will
help build some trust that will let you start bringing up the areas of underperformance
and introduce the corrective actions like training or skills coaching.

You should develop a plan to help the engineer develop the areas that they need to
address. What you put in the plan should be similar to SMART goals, but with the addition
of tools and next steps. The tools will be the resources you are providing that will
help them reach the goal (training, extra coaching meetings with you, a mentor for a
skill, recommended reading, etc), and the next steps will list what happens once the 
time for this plan is up. The plan must not be open-ended, and you must be specific
about what happens next -- even if the next step is "decide if we continue coaching."

In your plan, list the specific deficiencies and how they are relevant to
the person's role (hopefully you can relate this to a public and common description 
of the role responsibilities, like [a responsibility matrix for the role](create-career-development-paths.md)).
Describe how you measure the skill to assess if they are meeting the job requirements,
and give specific metrics so that it's is as objective as you can reasonably make it.
Set a time limit on the coaching period like 60, 90, or 180 days, and define the next
steps for what happens at that time. If you neglect any of those areas in your plan, 
you leave space for rules-lawyering, disagreement, and appeal, and probably fail to
get the person back on track.

Once you have built your plan, run it past a colleague or two, and your HR partner, to
get their input. They may have tips for you and can help you make the plan more effective.
Then have a specific meeting with the person to discuss the coaching plan -- don't take
over the one-on-one slot, because remember, that time is their time. If you've 
established some trust with the person, and you and they have already talked about the 
performance disparity between what they're doing and what is needed,
then you can have an open, two-way discussion about the specific points in the plan.
Take the time to get their feedback on the plan and hear their ideas about what would
help them be more effective, be clear when something is non-negotiable, and come to 
a mutual understanding so you're starting from the same place and agreed upon the goals.
