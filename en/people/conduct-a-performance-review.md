# How to conduct a performance review

The work of a performance review happens all year long. Ideally, when you have
a meeting, nobody is surprised by any of the feedback. Of course, that's not how it usually
happens.

Organizations have highly variable ideas of how to do performance management, ranging from
no annual reviews at all to highly involved 360Â° feedback processes. You may present
people with a raise that is a fait accompli, you may expect people to show up and negotiate
for any salary increases, or you may have a salary review process that's completely divorced
from performance reviews. The first thing to do, if you're new to your company, is to 
find out ahead of the "it's time to get ready for annual reviews!" reminders what your 
company does for performance and salary management, so you don't get taken by surprise
yourself. You'll need to do whatever the company process is, but if it's very minimal,
then don't let that keep you from making a better system for your team.

## About the process

Personally, I am not a fan of once-yearly infodump reviews, where you get invited to a
half-anticipated/half-dreaded hourlong meeting so your boss can inform you of your fate. 
Performance is something employees do on a daily basis; they deserve regular feedback.
It's as simple as that. 

If you have weekly or biweekly one-on-ones with each of your engineers, this is easy
to work in. Let people talk about how they are feeling, what challenges they have, what 
they are looking for from you, and opportunities to give feedback will
come up organically in conversation. Make sure you include regular checkpoints about 
career development, and a discussion about performance will flow from that. The key
is to just do it, and not put it off, especially when you have someone who needs
extra support or is underperforming.

## About the work people are doing

If you've done a good job [defining a job role matrix](create-career-development-paths.md)
for the engineers on your team, then you can be very straightforward about the work
that people are doing and whether or not it meets the expectations for their role. You
will be prepared to notice out when someone is overindexing on one area and neglecting
another, or when someone is spending too much time on glue work and not enough on their 
primary responsibilities. When you see that sort of
thing happening, you can step in to redirect people back to the right tasks, or find 
out why they are working on the wrong tasks. 

When it comes to [glue work](https://noidea.dog/glue) in particular: you may have one engineer who is the one
who makes space for everyone to contribute in meetings, who knows people on all the
other teams and can make connections to help unblock their colleagues, or who just
makes things happen and keeps the team performing at a high level. This work is called
glue work because it keeps things from coming apart. Especially if your teams are
cross-functional and this one engineer is the one who keeps tabs on everything, this
work is valuable and you should recognize the value that they bring. You should also
recognize that glue engineering is an anti-pattern. They are likely not doing it 
because they secretly want to be a TPM instead of a software developer, but because 
they saw a problem and knew someone had to keep things from falling apart, so they 
stepped up. That's leadership in action. Unfortunately, it often gets looked over 
and considered non-promotable work, so your valuable engineer who makes everyone 
else more effective winds up stuck, going nowhere, until they leave.
Have a frank discussion with glue engineers about why they are doing things, and
ask how you can help. And if they want to be doing engineering work but can't seem 
to get rid of the responsibilities they acquired by being glue, then you need
to make it possible for them to do so, by picking up the glue roles they've been
filling, or redirecting them away from tasks if necessary. But don't just let them
be glue forever, stagnating their careers by performing fewer core responsibilities
so they get lower raises and fewer promotions, while you and your team 
benefit from their work.


## About conversations

In general, people want more information, not less. If they are doing well, they want to
know what things they did well (so they can keep doing those things). Some people might
not realize they did well at all, especially people with high standards who think they
are "just doing their jobs." Showing that you were paying attention and you noticed when
someone did something well is a powerful tool for encouragement and increasing engagement.

But you also need to deliver constructively critical feedback. Engineers want data, because
you can't fix what you can't see. When someone does so-so, or outright poorly, they might
not enjoy hearing it (especially if they thought they did better), but your job as a 
manager is to have that conversation and help people learn and grow. 

Difficult conversations are hard and sometimes unpleasant, and nobody looks forward to
them, but as a manager you must be able to handle them without procrastination, with 
tact, and to have them productively. If you are not prepared for all three of those,
you cannot do all of your job. A manager who avoids conflict is not a leader.

When you are facing a difficult conversation with someone, you need a game plan. 
* What is the outcome that you need from the conversation? What key points do you have
to address to get to that outcome? Be clear about what you are trying to achieve.
* Have empathy for the person. 
* What questions and reactions do you anticipate getting? Is the employee going to shut down and be
unresponsive to you as you talk? Are they going to get defensive and rebut every
comment? Are they going to cry? You know how the person usually acts, so how will they 
be under this stress?
* Try role-playing the conversation with a trusted colleague, and get them to try
and trigger your stress reactions. Are you the kind of person who will get snappish if
someone gets defensive and says you did something wrong too, or will you back down and
start agreeing with the person that you are the one who messed up? Figure it out in 
advance, so you can avoid falling into that trap when it really matters.
