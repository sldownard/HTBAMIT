# How to increase engineer engagement

Engagement, as an employee, is the feeling that you are on board, you are
enthusiastic about what you're supposed to be doing, and you're actively doing it.
Engagement affects everything you do at work, from how much work you do to how
well you do it. And whether or not you have engaged employees can make or break
the success of your entire team or product. 

Engagement is the state of understanding what you are doing, how your goals relate
to the organizational goal, and being committed to the organization. Engagement 
is an emotional state, so it varies from person to person and from situation 
to situation, but when someone is engaged, their contributions can have much more
benefit to the organization. Gallup's 2017 analysis of engagement in companies 
found that companies in the top quartile of engaged workforces scored higher on 
customer metrics, profitability, and productivity, and lower on attrition, 
absenteeism, defects, and safety incidents.[1]

You can increase engineers' engagement by giving them reasons to feel committed 
to the organization. 
In general, authentic leadership (leaders who "are consistent between their 
values and actions and work together with the employees for the benefit of the 
organization"[2]) and values-based decisionmaking (having transparent values for
the organiation and team, and making decisions that align with those values, in
a predictable fashion) increase people's perception of your integrity. That
perceived integrity, the feeling that you're working for a good leader and a 
good organization, enhances employees' subjective sense of well-being with tools like
job crafting (letting people help shape their job duties, such as by implementing
a 20% rule). High engagement also occurs in diverse organizations with full 
participation by the minority members with a range of perspectives; this leads to
higher rates of creativity, and disrupts conformity, so people feel they are 
empowered and able to fully contribute.
