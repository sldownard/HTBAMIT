# How to create a roadmap for your product or team

People tend to get nervous when they know someone expects something from them, but
they don't know what or how. That's no different for a tech team with a remit but no roadmap.
Imagine being given a vague goal, with no specifics. How do you define what you're doing? How
do you start? If the team's expectations are an empty vacuum of undefined space, people 
will fill it somehow, but will they fill it with the right things? Now put yourself in 
the shoes of your customer: this thing I want, are you doing it? When will it be done, 
so I can use it? Those are the questions that a good roadmap answers, in whatever form it
takes.

Processes like Waterfall, Scrum, and Kanban are there to help you accomplish task work,
but they can't take over until you have an idea of what the task work is. If you are coming
in to a team as a new manager, you might know what they are there to do: run the publishing
platform. But what do you have to do to make sure that the newspaper goes
out every morning?

Depending on the team you're stepping into as manager for, you might have an existing roadmap
(ranging from accurate and reliable, to pure fantasy), or you might have nothing. Observe the 
situation and talk to people first, to assess the real condition of things. It might be that
you saw an absence of a published roadmap, but everyone is operating from a shared understanding
of what's being delivered when, and the only thing that's missing is a document. Or it might
be that you have a document but it's not very useful. By talking to the people on the team
and stakeholders, you will figure out what the deliverables and people's expectations are.
From there, you can create an updated roadmap, that covers the high-level priorities (not
the nuts and bolts). Bring that draft document to the team and stakeholders for discussion.
Are these the right priorities? Are they in the right order? 

Don't get too hung up on tools at this point. You don't need to learn Project and create 
a beautiful Gantt chart, you don't need all the milestones, epics, and stories in Jira. What 
you need is a list that people can look at, understand, and give you meaningful feedback 
about. You can do that with any wiki page or even a plaintext document.

Once you know about what it is that you're working on, start diving into high-level
definitions and time estimates. This is where it's handy to know a bit about the team's
velocity, but if your team hasn't been tracking that, don't spend all your time trying
to get precise dates. Get general dates and refine them over time. Your team may need
to make external commitments (so that you can announce products at an important industry
conference) or you may be able to be more casual (to deliver features to internal support
teams), and how you handle that will be up to you, but the important thing is to pick a
date and try to make it, and learn about sizing estimates as you go, so you get better
and more reliable about dates over time.
