# How to communicate a vision

Not every team is in the business of innovating -- some of us keep the lights on. But everyone 
needs to have a vision, so they know why they are there and feel motivated to contribute. 

You have likely worked for a team that didn't have a vision. Work priorities were muddled and
driven by individual feelings. One person felt that all the tickets needed to be handled
and worked day after day to close them, someone else felt like trying out new 
configuration management was the most valuable thing they could do, while yet another
person kept getting pulled into meetings and bringing back ideas that sounded good 
and caused a brief diversion but never seemed to wind up going anywhere. 

You might even have gotten your job as a manager because you stood up and said, "folks, what 
we need here is some sort of direction," and then set out to try and find some, in true "no
good deed goes unpunished" fashion.

Most people, and most teams, have what you can call a "default trajectory." This is the
path of inertia: you start out with an idea of where you're headed, and then you just follow
that path until something changes. It'll get you a little ways when you're a junior engineer,
and your path is simple (learn new tools or languages, build what people tell you to build) but as
a senior engineer and especially as a leader, you have to make educated decisions about
where you are going, what you are gaining and trading away with a given choice, what values 
influenced the decision and what makes this the right decision for right now, and how you
will benefit in the future. Sometimes you will have to place a bet on what the right
thing to do is. And you need to be able to communicate this to people in a way that 
engages their interest and creativity, and aligns them with this purpose. 

In short, the first step to communicating your vision is to figure out what it is. If 
you know what you're doing but can't explain why, it's hardly better than no vision at all.
And the first step to figuring out what your vision is is to understand what you value 
and how you make decisions.

Values-based decisionmaking is the idea that decisions are made with rationale that can
be understood and stated up front. Every time you make a decision, you base it on pros and
cons, in order to convince yourself that the outcome from your chosen decision will have the
most benefit. You must be honest with yourself on the pros and cons, though. If you do
not examine both sides fully on all options, you may make yourself susceptible to biases
or bad outcomes, such as in a salesperson who decides to go along with a price-fixing
request from his boss because they only considered the pros/cons as "keep my job"/"lose my
job" and not "keep my job but, if caught, pay huge fines and maybe go to jail"/"lose my
job but keep my integrity and my ability to find a new job in this field."

Understanding your values, and your organization's values, enables you to communicate
a vision because you will be able to explain the reasoning behind the decisions of what
to do and why, and why spending effort here and not there will achieve a greater 
outcome. When people understand the basis for your decisions and can see you moving in
ways consistent with those values, it will increase their perception of your integrity.
When your engineers are able to make their own decisions that are in concert 
with the vision, because they understand the decisionmaking process, the entire team 
acts consistently even on independent activities. 

When it comes time to have this talk with people, start with the values. What is
important to the organization? Be appropriately pragmatic and honest. Sometimes the goal 
is not to invent the next new thing, but to do better at something you're just okay at, 
and this is an opportunity to build trust through that honesty. After values, 
discuss the trade-offs, and pay special attention to things you are deprioritizing 
that previously were more important, to help stop people from reverting to their 
default trajectory when they feel conflicted about what to do next. And listen 
actively to them in return: what concerns do they have about the trade-offs? Maybe 
that engineer's worries about the ticket queue do have more merit than
you thought at first glance, because it turns out that some important alarms only 
ticket and don't page. You can only find these potential trouble spots and resolve
them when you have an open, two-way discussion, and people are not afraid to point
out things that you may have missed. 

Finally, ask for people's agreement. Getting an explicit assent makes something 
feel more real, and it cements a decision more than if you just assume everyone agrees.
