# How to build a coalition

A coalition is a group that is large enough, and has the right expertise, to accomplish
a task. In parliamentary style politics, parties that don't agree or even really like each other
may band together in a coalition when they want to work on the same problem; the trick 
is that they are committed to the task at hand and willing to compromise something in order
to make it happen. A coalition between teams might be similar -- the network and systems
teams join together to create a more effective load balancing and routing infrastructure
than either would have built on their own, but each team has to sacrifice a little of 
their usual autonomy within their specialty. 

The key to coalition is that you really have to be able to sell the idea that the 
end product will be better and bring much more value to the other team, than if they
just went on their own way. The systems people might ask the network people to include
them on the reviews and purchase of the load balancer products by pointing out that
evaluating the server selection algorithms and health check mechanisms will let them
find the load balancers that need the fewest trouble tickets to the network team 
to update the configs, and the big win for the network team there is that but cutting
those tickets down, they will have
to push fewer changes out through a slow and painstaking change approval process,
and that will save them one dev day per sprint, effort equal to an entire dev
month. Meanwhile, the systems people will be giving away their ability to point any
fingers of blame if the product doesn't work, but they will have the comfort of 
believing they helped make the best choice of all the options. And the engineers on
both teams will get to know each other through the process, establishing better
communication channels between the two teams for later when outage events occur.

When you need to get a coalition together, find the interested people, listen to what
their concerns are, figure out how you can solve problems for them at the same time that
you're solving problems for yourself, then convince them that two heads are better
than one. Last, go make it come true; give it all the effort and resources you 
would if you were working alone, to make sure the effort is a success. Make it work,
because the more successful a track record you have with cross-functional efforts, 
the more trust you will earn with other teams and with management that you can get
work done effectively, and ultimately, that will open more doors for you and your team.
