# How to build a bridge to another team

Creating a relationship with another team is a lot like creating a relationship with
a person: be proactive and reach out, don't just ping them when you want something from
them, have empathy for their position, and genuinely try to be a positive influence.
A lot of that starts with an introduction and asking how things are going.

You may find that an organization has several shapes. Warren Bennis describes surveying
organizations to study leadership, and finding four. There's the formal organization
strucutre, which appears on the org chart; the structure that people perceive the
organization to have; the actual structure that appears when you observe how people
actually get things done; and last, there's the structure that should exist in order 
for the organization to be able to complete its stated mission. Think about your 
organization: what super-structure is there that overlays the formal org chart, the
people or teams that you talk to when you need something, the informal, ad hoc 
coalitions that you have seen form to perform some task (or to stymie one)? 

You, as a manager, need to have some awareness of these informal structures, so 
that you can make things happen. When you identify a missing link between your team
and another team that you need, you'll need to build a bridge. 

Start by inventorying your network: who do you know that might know someone,
who could make an introduction? If you come up blank, ask someone in your department
who's been there a while, and see if they can tell you. They might not know anyone,
but they might be able to make a reasonable guess as to who else might know someone. 

Once you have a name, reach out, introduce yourself and share a little background
on your team and the problem space you're working on, and ask if they have any
ideas about where you can go for help. If this is a team you'll be working with
on a regular basis, a dependency or someone whose service has a dependency on
yours, think about if you can set up a regular one-on-one with the person to 
stay in touch and keep the communication going. Trade information with them -- tell
them what you're up to, don't just ask them what they're doing. We all want to 
have information on what's going on; information is currency in the office. Give
them something, so they have a reason to keep you in the loop in return. And make
other connections when you can, like if they are working on an operational issue
your team already looked into, ask if they want help from your team to help them
solve it faster. 

Once you have a good relationship set up, don't forget to maintain it. This takes
effort but it's the only way to maintain that bridge.  Keep in regular touch, 
even when you don't need anything, and make sure they know you
are willing to help if they need something. Your teams will be able to work 
more effectively together, and you may even be able to bring other teams
in to collaborate and have more influence within your organization as a result.
