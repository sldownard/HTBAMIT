# How to Keep Track of Things

When you are an individual contributor, you usually only have a few things to keep tabs on: a
project or two, some tickets you are assigned to, a project you are collaborating with others
on. The exact number will vary with individual style and responsibilities, but generally, it
is a low number.

For a line manager, you have all of the projects of all of your people, plus the longer-term
deliverables for your team, how it ties in with your organization's big goals, maybe even 
responsibility for even higher level goals. You have to keep track of how occupied people are
and the rate of work being done, so you know if you have enough people. You have to track the
nature of the work, and make strategy to accomplish the right work just in time. It's a lot,
and you might find yourself getting anxious or failing to do important things.

In general, you have three options for tasks: work, delegate, or drop. As an IC you probably did not
delegate much, and you almost certainly tried never to drop. But as a line manager, you will
have requests come in that you can safely delegate to others or choose not to fulfill (drop). 
This will not come easy for most
