# How to earn trust from others

When you become a manager, trust is currency that allows you to get things done. You will no longer
be doing tasks yourself, and instead, you will need to rely on others.
Whether those others are the people who report to you, your customers, your managers, or other 
people outside your team, you will need to earn their trust in order to gain their cooperation
and help.
