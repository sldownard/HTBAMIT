# How to earn trust from others

When you become a manager, trust is currency that allows you to get things done. You will no longer
be doing tasks yourself, and you will need to increasingly rely on others. 
Whether those others are the people who report to you, your customers, your managers, or other 
people outside your team, you will need to earn their trust in order to gain their cooperation
and help.

Successful managers have many skills, but they often revolve around the trust they have earned:
trust from those who report to them, trust from other teams that they need to work with, and 
trust from their own management to execute their obligations and vision. These are manifested
in ways like a team culture of accountability, transparency, and productivity, rather
than blame-shifting and politics; finding ways to motivate without micromanaging, and to 
roll with changes; and transparent, values-based decisionmaking where everyone understands and
can unite behind a decision. 

Trust is earned when people understand why you do what you do, and when you do what you say you
will do. Think of a corporate values statement: for example, Google's famous former motto, 
"Don't be evil." Actions that someone perceives as in line with not being evil builds trust that
Google walks the walk. However, if a Googler acts in a way that someone perceives as evil, 
and Google implicitly approves by permitting the action (or explicitly approves!), that someone
loses faith that the motto has any real meaning. 

Your values, as a manager, affect your team the same way: if you say that you believe in 
developing your engineers' careers, for example, but you micromanage them so that they aren't
able to build advanced skills, they will not trust that you actually care about their careers.
To build trust, you need to be transparent about your motives and the values that you use to
make decisions, then you need to stick to those. Predictability is at the heart of trust, and
if you lead people to believe you will act in a certain way, and then you actually do act
consistently with that way, they will come to trust you, ultimately making your team stronger
and more effective.
