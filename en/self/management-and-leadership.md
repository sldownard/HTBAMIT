# The difference between Management and Leadership

## Summary

The difference between management and leadership, according to the management books, is simple:
management is the administrative function, and leadership is the creative function. In short,
managers make sure people come to work, perform their job requirements, and get paid, and
leaders create ideas and opportunities, communicate them, and inspire people to participate.

To succeed as a people manager, you need to pull from both fields. Your people will need to
fulfill their essential job roles, and you need to inspire them to be creative and further
your organization's mission.  You may find yourself naturally falling
into one category more than the other, in which case you will need to find delegates to fill
the areas you are not directly handling. 

Are you an organizer by nature? Then you may find administration easy, and being a visionary
more difficult. Set aside time to brainstorm, both by yourself and with your team. Imagination
is a skill you can build, as are public speaking (to inspire people) and persuasion (to get
them to follow you). Remember that engineering is a creative pursuit; people want to solve
interesting problems and make cool things. If you don't inspire creativity, your team may be
left feeling unfulfilled and bored.

Or are you a visionary, and the idea of approving expense reports weekly sounds like something
you'd rather ignore? Make a todo list, and put meetings on your own calendar to take care of
administrative work. Administration is a core function for any organization, and if you are
disorganized it will cause headaches from your team, and there is only so long people will
put up with chaos before they seek refuge.

Find goals for yourself by thinking about which tasks make you feel comfortable, and which do
not. It's important to be honest with yourself, and honest with those around you, about the
things you are working to improve. Being honest with others will earn you the trust of others,
because we all know no one is perfect, not even our bosses.
