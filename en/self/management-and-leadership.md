# The difference between management and leadership

The difference between management and leadership, according to the management books, is simple:
management is the administrative function, and leadership is the creative function. In short,
managers make sure people come to work, perform their job requirements, and get paid; and
leaders create ideas and opportunities, communicate them, and inspire people to move the
organization forward.

To succeed as a people manager, you need to pull from both fields. Your people will need to
fulfill their essential job roles, and you need to inspire them to be creative and further
your organization's mission.  You may find yourself naturally falling
into one category more than the other, in which case you will need to make special efforts
to cover the other, such as by forcing yourself to develop new skills outside your normal
comfort zone, or by finding other people who can fill in for areas you aren't covering.

Are you an organizer by nature? Then you may find administration easy, and being a visionary
more difficult. Set aside time to brainstorm, both by yourself and with your team. Imagination
is a skill you can build, as are empathy (understanding where other people are coming from), 
public speaking (to inspire people) and persuasion (to get them to follow you). 
Remember that engineering is a creative pursuit; people want to solve
interesting problems and make cool things. If you don't inspire creativity, your team may be
left feeling unfulfilled and bored.

Or are you a visionary, and the idea of approving expense reports weekly sounds like something
you'd rather ignore? Make a todo list, and put meetings on your own calendar to take care of
administrative work. Administration is a core function for any organization; if you are
disorganized it will cause your team headaches, and there is only so long people will
put up with chaos before they find something better.

Find goals for yourself by thinking about which tasks make you feel comfortable, and which do
not. It's important to be honest with yourself, and honest with those around you, about the
things you are working to improve. Being honest with others will earn you the trust of others,
because we all know no one is perfect, not even our bosses.
