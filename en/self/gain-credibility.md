# How to gain credibility

Credibility is the quality of being believable, and of having others trust that you know what 
you're talking about. As an engineer, you had credibility due to your skills and talents, and 
that let you make changes and move the system forward. As a manager, you need credibility,
but the skills people need to believe in are different. Instead, you need people to believe
that your judgment is sound (so they will take your guidance on), that you have the right
relationships with others (so they can come to you to make a connection in your network when 
they don't know who to talk to), and that they can rely on you to give them accurate 
information. 

Credibility is closely related to [trust](earn-trust-from-others.md), as believing that you
know what you're talking about takes a certain about of trust, especially in situations where
the other person isn't familiar with the subject area and can't objectively rate your skill
for themselves. But credibility is also built up by demonstrating your skill. If you say that 
you know who to involve to solve something, and you find the right person and they do solve
it, then next time you say you know someone, people will believe that you do.

As a manager, you will have to have a different type of credibility than you had to have 
as an engineer. As an IC, you had to know what you were doing to solve technical 
problems, but as a manager, your problems are people-related. You will need to know many
people and understand at least enough about what they do to know how they can help your 
team, or related teams, and to know their motivations so you can offer your team's
skills at the right times. You will need to understand at least enough politics to make your
way through sometimes-complex meshes of opinions, interpersonal relationships, and history,
without blundering and inadvertently stepping on toes or making a situation worse. And you
will need to have your team deliver on its roadmap, so that you build a track record of
shipping what you committed to.

How do you do those things? Some of it is in your control, and other things are not. You
need to have the wisdom to judge, and to understand when you can act autonomously and 
directly to make a change (such as changing a change request form to consolidate duplicate 
fields, or automating integ testing approvals before deployment rather than someone 
having to manually confirm and push to prod) versus where you will have to understand where 
someone else is coming from and then drive change collaboratively. 

Start by standing back and observing before you suggest changes; get the
lay of the land. This process will take time; some things you will only need a couple of
weeks to see what's going on, but others will take months. And the wait-and-see approach
applies to processes within your team as well as externally. If you come in to your first 
team retro full of suggestions for how they "should" do things, without being aware of what your
team has already proposed and tried in the past and their thinking about it, they will 
not be receptive; nor will a change review board be receptive to sudden complaints that
your old company did change review "so much faster" if you do not understand their reasoning
first. 

During the process of observing, talk to people, and ask questions. Actively listen to 
people's responses. Learn about the history of how people used to do things, and why 
they are doing things the way they are today. Try to understand the full context of
all the moving parts in the system: how does the organization balance, right now, the
competing demands from customers to ship features, from engineers to use continuous
deployments with adequate test coverage, from the business to meet compliance and tax 
requirements? Once you have a good idea of how everything works, and (importantly) people
believe that you have enough background to understand the system, your suggestions
will have the weight of credibility behind them.
