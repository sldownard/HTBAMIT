# How to gain credibility

Credibility is the quality of being believable, and of having others trust that you know what 
you're talking about. As an engineer, you had credibility due to your skills and talents, and 
that let you make changes and move the system forward. As a manager, you need credibility,
but the skills people need to believe in are different. Instead, you need people to believe
that your judgment is sound (so they will take your guidance on), that you have the right
relationships with others (so they can come to you to make a connection in your network when 
they don't know who to talk to), and that they can rely on you to give them accurate 
information.
