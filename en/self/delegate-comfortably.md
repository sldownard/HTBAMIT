# How to delegate comfortably

You will not be able to do all that you are asked to do, as a manager. That is just how it
goes. Sometimes you will have to say no to a task that is not as important as others, and 
sometimes you have to give a task to someone else. You will need to hand off all sorts of 
tasks, and sometimes it will be something you really, really wanted to do yourself, whether 
that's because you want to keep an eye on quality, it's the kind of tech you care deeply 
about, or just something you want to learn. Delegating will keep your workload reasonable, 
help get work done on time, and it will develop new skills for your team and make them 
better, more effective engineers.

For someone coming from an IC background, delegating doesn't come naturally. You got here 
because you excelled at work in your field! But now it's time for your team members
to take that work on, because they need to learn to excel, too, to develop their careers. 
As a manager, it's your job to funnel the right work to people so that they are continuously 
being given appropriate challenges to keep them interested and engaged. If you hold back 
the challenging work, people will notice, and they will interpret that as a lack of trust 
or you hoarding "the good projects." On the other hand, if you funnel projects to people
without giving them the right support to actually complete it to a high standard, like
giving someone something that's over their head and not being there when they ask you for
a pointer, people will feel set up to fail. 

Delegating appropriately takes three skills:
* Know your own capabilities. Your todo list is a stack that can only hold so much, and
  either a new task will pop something out, or you will have to pop something off yourself
  to let the new task in. This means sometimes you have to say "no," and sometimes you
  have to say "yes, but," as in, "yes, but I'll assign that task to Alice."
* Communicate well, and be aware of your blind spots when it comes to "what everyone knows." 
  Not everyone will
  "just know" how to implement something that you have internalized the requirements on. 
  This is especially important when you're delegating something that will challenge 
  someone. You want them to succeed, both for them and for the work, so make sure you give
  the delegate all the information, not just the key points.
* Correctly prioritize the work relative to other work.  Know when to interrupt and when 
  to queue. Rapidly changing "top priority" will cause cynicism and then attrition, and 
  it will drive your credbility down.
* Understand the level of skill that each of your engineers is at, and tailor your approach
  appropriately. If you set someone up
  for a challenge that they're not prepared for, you can get a poor work product as well
  as damage that person's trust in you. Conversely, if you give someone something that's
  under their self-perceived skill level, without explanation, they may feel like you don't
  understand or don't care about their career goals; you're giving them "the scut work."

Delegating is a way to accomplish more work, build skills and cross-train people on the 
team, and meet the requirements that others will have for your team. If you learn to do it
well, both you and your team will build trust and credibility.
