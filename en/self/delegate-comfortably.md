# How to delegate comfortably

You will not be able to do all that you are asked to do, as a manager. Sometimes that means
you will have to say no to a task that is not as important as others, but sometimes it means
you have to give a task to someone else. You will need to hand off all sorts of tasks, and
sometimes it will be something you really, really want to do yourself (whether that's because
you want to ensure the highest quality, or it's something you care deeply about, or just 
something you want to learn). Delegating will keep your workload reasonable, help get work
done on time, and it will develop new skills for your team and make them more effective.

For someone coming from an IC background, delegating doesn't come naturally. You got here 
because you excelled at doing work in your field! But now it's time for your team members
to take that work on, because they need to learn to excel, too, in order to develop their
careers. As a manager, it's your job to funnel the right work to people so that 
they are continuously being given appropriate challenges to keep them interested and 
engaged. If you hold back the challenging work, people will notice, and they will interpret
that as a lack of trust or you hoarding "the good projects," and eventually, they will 
leave. 

Having your current to-do list under control will help you delegate, as you will understand
how much effort you can spare for a new task. You will need to be able to gauge priority,
not just so that you know it's not something you should have said "no" to instead of 
agreeing, but because after you do agree to it, you will need to communicate that priority
to the person you delegate the work to. If you agree to a task that's done next week, and
then give it to an engineer who thinks they have two or three weeks to complete it, you
are setting them up to fail.
