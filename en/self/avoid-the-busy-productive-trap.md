# How to avoid the "busy = productive" trap.

Sometimes we can be tempted to believe that just because we are busy, we are doing the right work,
and being productive. It isn't necessarily the case. There are many demands on a team's time, and
on a manager's time, and you will have to learn to say no to some things, and to delegate others,
so that you can focus on doing a good job with the things that truly need to be done.

Being busy is the nature of being a tech worker, because there is always something to do.
But being productive is not the same as being busy; being productive is when you're doing the
right work, producing the right results to advance your organization's mission. You could
be busy all day long replacing printer paper but if you don't ship features then what was
the point? Choose the right work, by understanding the organization's mission and making 
trade-offs between that which is required for operations and that which moves the organization
forward. That might mean letting [technical debt](../team/address-technical-debt.md) stagnate 
and noisy alarms continue to fire, while you focus on migrating to a new deployment system that 
will have better automated integ testing approvals and auto-rollback so the defects don't get
out in the first place. When you make a choice like that, make sure that your team 
understands the reasoning and what they should be doing. Communication is how you get
everyone to commit, especially when they are inclined to disagree. Without commitment, you
can find people feeling left out or resentful. For example, if someone feels that
the tickets absolutely must be investigated and closed out, while others agreed to let
them lie to pursue the long term fix, then that person may feel bitter (they kept operations running at a high level
of quality, but no one else did!) and and unappreciated (they didn't have much 
to do with the new system, which got all the praise, because they were busy with tickets).

Another aspect to mistakenly linking busy with productive is being always on. You most likely
do not have to read every work email at 10PM or on weekends. And your team does not have to 
respond to work emails at 10PM either. If you have to demonstrate to your boss that you are 
concerned only about the work, by responding to requests at all hours, that is performative 
behavior, not productive behavior. One: you should shield your team from this, it's toxic and
will cause poor morale and attrition; and two: that's unhealthy for you and you should change 
that expectation. Changing doesn't necessarily mean quitting (although it might, if you are
in a really toxic environment), but it means setting boundaries, getting agreement from your
manager, and sticking to it.
